:woman_technologist: My transition into web development has been one of the most exciting and rewarding adventures I've undertaken. I bring with me a background in operations management, finance, and customer service. While my previous roles were multi-faceted, one of my favourite parts was learning how to build and expand our database software. This enjoyment has led me to pursue software development as a career and complete the bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa :new_zealand: :coffee:

:airplane: My final group project at Dev Academy has plans for the future, check out the current deployed site here - https://triphive.pushed.nz/
This was created by a group of four, with 8 days from the initial idea through to presentation of the project at our Showcase evening. I have been continuing work on this to implement new features and expand the project :earth_asia: :palm_tree:
